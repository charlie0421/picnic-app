# Task ID: 19
# Title: Expand Unit Test Coverage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Increase unit test coverage for core business logic to over 80%.
# Details:
Use 'mockito' package (version 5.4.0) for mocking dependencies in tests. Implement test-driven development (TDD) for new features. Use 'coverage' package to generate coverage reports. Integrate coverage checks in the CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for all public methods in core business logic. Use parameterized tests for comprehensive test cases. Implement mutation testing using 'mutest' package to ensure test quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Generate and review the current test coverage report for the Flutter app, identifying untested code paths and modules, including those using Supabase, Firebase, Riverpod, and the lazy loading system.
### Details:
Run `flutter test --coverage` to produce the lcov.info file. Use coverage visualization tools (e.g., Flutter Coverage extension, Coverage Gutters) to pinpoint areas with low coverage and document specific files and functions needing more tests.

## 2. Identify and Prioritize Core Logic for Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: List and prioritize core business logic, state management flows, and asynchronous operations (including Supabase, Firebase, Riverpod, and lazy loading) that require thorough unit and widget test coverage.
### Details:
Break down the app into logical modules and features. For each, specify critical functions, classes, and state transitions that must be tested, focusing on areas with low or no coverage.

## 3. Write and Refactor Unit and Widget Tests for Core Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Develop or refactor unit and widget tests to cover the prioritized core logic, ensuring tests are meaningful and verify both expected and edge-case behaviors.
### Details:
Implement tests for business logic, state management (Riverpod), and integration points with Supabase and Firebase. Ensure tests are isolated, deterministic, and follow best practices for maintainability.

## 4. Implement Parameterized and Mutation Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Enhance test robustness by introducing parameterized tests and mutation testing to uncover hidden bugs and ensure code resilience.
### Details:
Use Dart's test package features for parameterized tests. Integrate mutation testing tools (e.g., mutmut, Stryker) to automatically introduce code mutations and verify that tests fail as expected, indicating strong test coverage.

## 5. Integrate Tests into Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Configure the CI system to automatically run all tests (unit, widget, integration, parameterized, mutation) on every commit and pull request.
### Details:
Update CI configuration (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) to execute `flutter test --coverage` and mutation tests. Ensure failures block merges and provide clear feedback to developers.

## 6. Automate Coverage Reporting and Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.5
### Description: Set up automated generation and publishing of test coverage reports, making them accessible to the team and highlighting areas needing improvement.
### Details:
Configure the CI pipeline to generate lcov.info and publish HTML coverage reports (e.g., using genhtml). Optionally, integrate with coverage dashboards or badges for visibility in the repository.

## 7. Review, Maintain, and Iterate on Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Regularly review test coverage metrics, update tests as the codebase evolves, and ensure new features and bug fixes are accompanied by appropriate tests.
### Details:
Establish a process for periodic coverage review, enforce minimum coverage thresholds, and require tests for all new code paths. Continuously refine tests to improve quality and maintainability.
