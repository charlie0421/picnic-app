# Task ID: 19
# Title: Expand Unit Test Coverage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14, 15, 17, 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Increase unit test coverage for core business logic to over 80%.
# Details:
Use 'mockito' package (version 5.4.0) for mocking dependencies in tests. Implement test-driven development (TDD) for new features. Use 'coverage' package to generate coverage reports. Integrate coverage checks in the CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for all public methods in core business logic. Use parameterized tests for comprehensive test cases. Implement mutation testing using 'mutest' package to ensure test quality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Analyze Current Test Coverage [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Assess the existing test coverage across all modules using appropriate metrics (e.g., statement, branch, and function coverage) to identify gaps and prioritize areas for improvement.
### Details:
Use tools and coverage reports to determine which parts of the codebase are insufficiently tested. Document uncovered or under-tested areas for targeted test development.

## 2. Define Core Logic and Critical Paths [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Identify and document the core logic and critical paths in the application that require thorough testing based on risk and requirements analysis.
### Details:
Work with stakeholders and developers to map out essential business logic, high-risk modules, and user flows that must be prioritized for test coverage.

## 3. Write Unit and Integration Tests for Core Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests targeting the core logic and critical paths identified in the previous step.
### Details:
Ensure tests cover all relevant scenarios, including edge cases and error handling, to maximize statement and branch coverage.

## 4. Implement Parameterized Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Enhance test suites by introducing parameterized tests to efficiently cover multiple input combinations and edge cases.
### Details:
Refactor existing tests or write new ones using parameterization features of the test framework to increase coverage and reduce code duplication.

## 5. Apply Mutation Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.4
### Description: Integrate mutation testing tools to evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite in detecting code changes and potential defects.
### Details:
Run mutation tests, analyze surviving mutants, and improve tests where necessary to ensure robust defect detection.

## 6. Integrate Tests into CI Pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.5
### Description: Configure the continuous integration (CI) system to automatically execute all tests, including parameterized and mutation tests, on every code change.
### Details:
Set up CI jobs to run the full test suite and fail builds if coverage thresholds are not met or if tests fail.

## 7. Generate and Report Test Coverage Metrics [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Automate the generation and distribution of test coverage reports, ensuring visibility of coverage metrics and trends to all stakeholders.
### Details:
Use coverage tools to produce detailed reports and integrate them with dashboards or notifications for ongoing monitoring and improvement.
