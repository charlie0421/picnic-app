Implement proper sizing for Flex widget children:\n   - Wrap child widgets with Expanded or Flexible where appropriate\n   - Example: \n     ```dart\n     Row(\n       children: [\n         Expanded(\n           child: Text('Long text that might overflow'),\n         ),\n         Icon(Icons.star),\n       ],\n     )\n     ```\n\n3. Optimize Text widgets:\n   - Set maxLines and overflow properties for Text widgets\n   - Example:\n     ```dart\n     Text(\n       'Long description text',\n       maxLines: 2,\n       overflow: TextOverflow.ellipsis,\n     )\n     ```\n\n4.

Implement a custom ErrorWidget to identify overflow issues in production:\n    - Override the ErrorWidget.builder to provide more informative error messages\n    - Example:\n      ```dart\n      ErrorWidget.builder = (FlutterErrorDetails details) {\n        return Container(\n          color: Colors.red,\n          child: Text(\n            'An error occurred: ${details.exception}',\n            style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white),\n          ),\n        );\n      };\n      ```\n\n12.
