# Task ID: 17
# Title: Optimize State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Standardize the use of Provider/Riverpod for state management across the app.
# Details:
Use 'riverpod' package (version 2.3.6) for state management. Implement consistent state management patterns across features. Use 'flutter_hooks' package (version 0.18.6) for optimizing widget lifecycle management. Implement proper state disposal to prevent memory leaks.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each state management class. Implement widget tests to verify correct state propagation. Use Flutter DevTools to monitor widget rebuilds and optimize performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Conduct State Management Audit [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the current state management approaches used across the app, identify inconsistencies, and document areas needing standardization.
### Details:
Analyze usage of setState, Provider, BLoC, and any custom solutions. Note where state is lifted unnecessarily or where state management is inefficient.

## 2. Plan and Integrate Riverpod [done]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Develop a migration plan for integrating Riverpod as the primary state management solution, ensuring compatibility with existing architecture.
### Details:
Map out which features and modules will transition to Riverpod, and outline steps for incremental integration.

## 3. Optimize Widget Lifecycle Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Review and refactor widget build methods to minimize unnecessary rebuilds and optimize widget lifecycle handling.
### Details:
Implement best practices such as using const constructors, keys, and KeepAlive where appropriate. Convert StatefulWidgets to StatelessWidgets when possible.

## 4. Implement State Disposal and Cleanup [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Ensure proper disposal of state and resources to prevent memory leaks and performance degradation.
### Details:
Audit and update providers, controllers, and listeners to dispose resources correctly, especially during widget unmounting.

## 5. Migrate Existing Features to Riverpod [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.4
### Description: Refactor existing features to use Riverpod for state management, replacing legacy patterns and ensuring feature parity.
### Details:
Systematically update modules, test for regressions, and document migration steps for future reference.

## 6. Develop and Execute Testing Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.5
### Description: Create and run unit, widget, and integration tests to validate state management logic and ensure app stability post-migration.
### Details:
Focus on testing state transitions, provider logic, and UI updates. Ensure coverage for edge cases and error handling.

## 7. Implement Performance Monitoring and Tuning [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up performance monitoring tools and optimize app performance based on collected metrics.
### Details:
Monitor widget rebuilds, memory usage, and app responsiveness. Address bottlenecks and fine-tune state management for optimal performance.
