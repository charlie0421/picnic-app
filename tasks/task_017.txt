# Task ID: 17
# Title: Optimize State Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Standardize the use of Provider/Riverpod for state management across the app.
# Details:
Use 'riverpod' package (version 2.3.6) for state management. Implement consistent state management patterns across features. Use 'flutter_hooks' package (version 0.18.6) for optimizing widget lifecycle management. Implement proper state disposal to prevent memory leaks.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each state management class. Implement widget tests to verify correct state propagation. Use Flutter DevTools to monitor widget rebuilds and optimize performance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Audit Current State Management Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review the existing state management approaches (Riverpod, Supabase, Firebase, delayed loading system) across the entire Flutter app. Identify all stateful features, their dependencies, and any inconsistencies or anti-patterns.
### Details:
Document all providers, state notifiers, and their usage. Note any direct widget state management or legacy patterns that need migration.

## 2. Plan and Integrate Riverpod for Unified State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Design a standardized Riverpod-based state management architecture. Integrate Riverpod throughout the app, ensuring ProviderScope is correctly set up at the root and all providers are statically defined.
### Details:
Refactor existing state logic to use Riverpod providers, StateNotifiers, and dependency injection best practices. Avoid dynamic provider creation and side effects in provider initialization.

## 3. Optimize Widget Lifecycle and State Disposal [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2
### Description: Analyze widget lifecycle usage and ensure proper state disposal to prevent memory leaks. Refactor widgets to use ConsumerWidget or ConsumerStatefulWidget as appropriate, and verify providers are disposed of correctly.
### Details:
Implement best practices for provider and widget lifecycle management, such as using autoDispose providers where needed and avoiding ephemeral state in providers.

## 4. Migrate Existing Features to New State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Systematically migrate all app features to the new Riverpod-based state management system. Replace legacy state logic and ensure all dependencies (Supabase, Firebase) are integrated via providers.
### Details:
Update feature modules, screens, and services to use the new providers. Ensure API clients and async operations are managed through Riverpod.

## 5. Implement and Update Testing for State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.4
### Description: Develop and update unit, widget, and integration tests to cover the new state management logic. Ensure all providers and state transitions are thoroughly tested.
### Details:
Write tests for StateNotifiers, providers, and widget interactions. Mock dependencies as needed and verify correct state disposal and lifecycle behavior.

## 6. Monitor and Optimize Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.5
### Description: Set up performance monitoring tools and analyze the impact of the new state management system. Identify and resolve any performance bottlenecks related to provider rebuilds, widget lifecycle, or async operations.
### Details:
Use Flutter DevTools and Riverpod debugging tools to track provider rebuilds and memory usage. Optimize provider granularity and widget rebuilds as needed.

## 7. Document Architecture and Best Practices [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the new state management architecture, migration steps, and best practices for future development.
### Details:
Include guidelines for provider creation, widget lifecycle management, state disposal, and integration with Supabase/Firebase. Share documentation with the development team.
