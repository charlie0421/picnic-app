# Task ID: 3
# Title: Improve App Startup Time
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the initialization process to reduce app startup time.
# Details:
Implement lazy loading of non-critical components. Use Flutter's deferred loading for heavy widgets. Optimize asset loading by using appropriate image formats and sizes. Implement asynchronous initialization where possible. Use the 'flutter_native_splash' package (version 2.3.1) for a faster perceived startup time.

# Test Strategy:
Use Flutter's 'dart:developer' TimelineTask API to measure startup phases. Implement automated performance tests using the 'integration_test' package. Compare startup times across different devices using Firebase Test Lab.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profile Current Startup Performance [in-progress]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze and benchmark the current app startup process to identify bottlenecks and establish a baseline for optimization.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to measure startup time, main thread activity, and asset loading. Document findings for comparison after optimizations.

## 2. Implement Lazy Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Defer the initialization and loading of non-essential components and resources until they are needed after startup.
### Details:
Refactor code to load only critical modules and assets at launch, implementing lazy initialization for secondary features and resources.

## 3. Optimize Asset Loading [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Reduce the size and number of assets loaded during startup to minimize initial load time.
### Details:
Compress images, remove unnecessary resources, and streamline asset management to ensure only essential assets are loaded at startup.

## 4. Refactor Initialization Code [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Restructure and optimize the app's initialization logic to eliminate unnecessary processing and improve efficiency.
### Details:
Review and refactor startup routines, removing redundant operations and ensuring initialization code is as lean as possible.

## 5. Integrate Splash Screen Improvements [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.4
### Description: Enhance the splash screen to provide a smoother and faster transition into the app.
### Details:
Simplify splash screen design, reduce its display duration, and ensure it does not block or delay essential startup processes.

## 6. Measure and Compare Results [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.5
### Description: Re-profile the app after optimizations to quantify improvements and validate that startup performance goals are met.
### Details:
Repeat profiling and benchmarking, compare new metrics to the baseline, and document the impact of each optimization step.
