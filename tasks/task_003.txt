# Task ID: 3
# Title: Improve App Startup Time
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize the initialization process to reduce app startup time.
# Details:
Implement lazy loading of non-critical components. Use Flutter's deferred loading for heavy widgets. Optimize asset loading by using appropriate image formats and sizes. Implement asynchronous initialization where possible. Use the 'flutter_native_splash' package (version 2.3.1) for a faster perceived startup time.

# Test Strategy:
Use Flutter's 'dart:developer' TimelineTask API to measure startup phases. Implement automated performance tests using the 'integration_test' package. Compare startup times across different devices using Firebase Test Lab.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profile Current Startup Performance [done]

### Description: Analyze the current startup sequence of the Flutter app using Flutter DevTools and other profiling tools to identify bottlenecks and measure baseline startup time.
### Details:
Collect metrics on cold and hot start times, memory usage, and CPU utilization during app launch. Document any expensive operations occurring during initialization.
