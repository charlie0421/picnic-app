# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhance Offline Mode Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve user experience during network errors and ensure data consistency in offline mode.
# Details:
Implement offline-first architecture using the 'moor' package (version 4.6.1+1) for local database. Use 'sqflite' (version 2.2.8+4) for efficient SQL database operations. Implement data synchronization logic using 'synchronized' package (version 3.1.0). Use 'retry' package (version 3.1.2) for automatic retrying of failed network requests.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for offline data operations. Implement integration tests simulating various offline scenarios. Use network connection interceptors in tests to simulate offline mode.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Local Database [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure a local database (e.g., SQLite, Hive, or Drift) for offline data storage in the Flutter app.
### Details:
Choose a suitable local database solution, define data models, and implement CRUD operations for storing and retrieving data locally.

## 2. Implement Offline-First Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Refactor the app's data layer to prioritize local data access and ensure seamless offline functionality.
### Details:
Modify repositories and data providers to read from and write to the local database first, falling back to remote sources only when necessary.

## 3. Develop Synchronization Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to synchronize local data with remote backends (Supabase, Firebase) when connectivity is restored.
### Details:
Implement background sync tasks, queue offline changes, and ensure data consistency between local and remote sources.

## 4. Add Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement robust retry logic for failed network requests and sync operations.
### Details:
Design exponential backoff strategies and persistent retry queues to handle intermittent connectivity and ensure eventual consistency.

## 5. Implement Conflict Resolution [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Design and implement strategies to resolve data conflicts between local and remote sources during synchronization.
### Details:
Define conflict resolution policies (e.g., last-write-wins, manual merge) and integrate them into the sync logic.

## 6. Conduct Offline Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Test the app's offline capabilities, sync logic, and conflict resolution under various connectivity scenarios.
### Details:
Simulate offline/online transitions, network failures, and concurrent updates to validate robustness and user experience.

## 7. Document Offline-First Features [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the offline-first architecture, sync logic, retry mechanisms, and conflict resolution strategies.
### Details:
Document code structure, usage guidelines, and troubleshooting steps for future maintainers and contributors.
