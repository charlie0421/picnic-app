# Task ID: 7
# Title: Enhance Offline Mode Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Improve user experience during network errors and ensure data consistency in offline mode.
# Details:
Implement offline-first architecture using the 'moor' package (version 4.6.1+1) for local database. Use 'sqflite' (version 2.2.8+4) for efficient SQL database operations. Implement data synchronization logic using 'synchronized' package (version 3.1.0). Use 'retry' package (version 3.1.2) for automatic retrying of failed network requests.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for offline data operations. Implement integration tests simulating various offline scenarios. Use network connection interceptors in tests to simulate offline mode.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Local Database Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a local database structure to store application data for offline access
### Details:
Implement a DatabaseService class that handles data persistence using SQL or another appropriate storage solution. Create schema designs, database migrations, and CRUD operations for all required data models. Ensure efficient querying capabilities for offline data access.

## 2. Repository Layer Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create repository classes that act as the single source of truth for data access
### Details:
Develop repository classes (like UserProfileRepository) that combine local and remote data sources. Implement methods to fetch, update, and manage data regardless of connectivity state. Ensure repositories handle data consistency between local and remote sources.

## 3. Synchronization Logic Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Develop mechanisms for data synchronization between local and remote databases
### Details:
Implement both manual and scheduled sync capabilities. Create First Time Sync (FTS) logic for initial data population and Delta sync for subsequent updates. Add queue management for pending operations and develop background sync processes.

## 4. Conflict Resolution Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Design and implement conflict resolution mechanisms for data synchronization
### Details:
Create strategies for handling conflicts when the same data is modified both locally and remotely. Implement version tracking, timestamp-based resolution, or custom merge logic. Develop user interfaces for manual conflict resolution when necessary.

## 5. Network Failure Handling and Retry Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3
### Description: Implement robust error handling and retry logic for network operations
### Details:
Develop exponential backoff algorithms for retry attempts. Create network status monitoring to detect connectivity changes. Implement queuing systems for failed operations that automatically retry when connectivity is restored.

## 6. Offline Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Create comprehensive testing infrastructure for offline functionality
### Details:
Develop unit tests for repository and sync logic. Create integration tests simulating various network conditions. Implement UI tests for offline user experience. Build automated test scenarios for sync conflicts and resolution strategies.

## 7. Documentation and Developer Guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the offline-first architecture
### Details:
Document the overall architecture, data flow diagrams, and component interactions. Create developer guidelines for working with the offline system. Provide code examples and best practices for implementing new features with offline support.
