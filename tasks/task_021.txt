# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Device Compatibility Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automate testing for various device resolutions and OS versions.
# Details:
Use Firebase Test Lab for testing on multiple device configurations. Implement responsive design using 'flutter_screenutil' package (version 5.8.4). Use 'device_preview' package (version 1.1.0) for simulating different devices during development.

# Test Strategy:
Create a matrix of test devices covering various screen sizes and OS versions. Implement screenshot tests for key screens across different devices. Conduct manual testing on physical devices for final verification.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test Matrix Definition [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define comprehensive test matrices for Android and iOS platforms
### Details:
Create test configurations specifying device models, OS versions, screen sizes, and orientations to ensure broad coverage. Include popular devices like Samsung Galaxy series, Google Pixel, iPhone models, and iPads. Define minimum 5 Android and 5 iOS configurations.

## 2. Responsive Design Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Implement tests to verify UI responsiveness across different screen sizes
### Details:
Create widget tests that validate layout adaptability using MediaQuery to simulate different screen dimensions. Test critical UI components with Supabase and Firebase integration points. Verify that UI elements properly resize and reposition across breakpoints.

## 3. Device Simulation Environment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Configure testing environment with Firebase Test Lab integration
### Details:
Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions for automated testing on Firebase Test Lab. Configure test runners for both Android and iOS platforms. Implement test reporting and notification system for failed tests. Ensure proper authentication for Firebase services.

## 4. Screenshot Testing Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Develop automated screenshot comparison tests for UI verification
### Details:
Implement golden tests for key screens with Riverpod state variations. Create baseline screenshots for different device configurations. Set up comparison logic with acceptable threshold for differences. Include tests for loading states with the implemented lazy loading system.

## 5. Manual Verification Checklist [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Create structured manual testing procedures for final verification
### Details:
Develop step-by-step test scripts for critical user journeys. Include verification points for Supabase data persistence, Firebase authentication flows, and Riverpod state management edge cases. Create performance benchmarks for lazy loading system across different network conditions.
