# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Device Compatibility Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Automate testing for various device resolutions and OS versions.
# Details:
Use Firebase Test Lab for testing on multiple device configurations. Implement responsive design using 'flutter_screenutil' package (version 5.8.4). Use 'device_preview' package (version 1.1.0) for simulating different devices during development.

# Test Strategy:
Create a matrix of test devices covering various screen sizes and OS versions. Implement screenshot tests for key screens across different devices. Conduct manual testing on physical devices for final verification.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Test Matrix [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a comprehensive test matrix identifying all device types, screen sizes, browsers, and orientations to be tested
### Details:
Include popular desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with various screen resolutions. Document browser versions to test (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Include both portrait and landscape orientations for mobile devices. Prioritize devices based on user analytics if available.

## 2. Implement Responsive Design Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Develop automated tests to verify responsive design elements across different viewport sizes
### Details:
Create scripts to validate element visibility, content adaptation, layout consistency, and media responsiveness. Test navigation menus, forms, images, and interactive elements at each breakpoint. Verify font scaling and spacing between elements maintains readability.

## 3. Configure Device Simulation Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Set up device emulation and simulation tools for automated responsive testing
### Details:
Install and configure tools like Chrome DevTools, BrowserStack, or LambdaTest for device simulation. Set up mobile automation frameworks (Appium, XCTest, Espresso) for native testing. Configure viewport dimensions to match devices in the test matrix.

## 4. Implement Visual Regression Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2, 21.3
### Description: Set up automated screenshot comparison across different devices and screen sizes
### Details:
Integrate visual regression tools like Applitools Eyes or Percy. Create baseline screenshots for each device/viewport combination. Implement automated comparison to detect visual differences between builds. Configure threshold settings for acceptable differences.

## 5. Perform Manual Verification and Edge Cases [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.4
### Description: Conduct manual testing to verify automated results and test edge cases
### Details:
Manually verify critical user journeys on actual devices. Test orientation changes in real-time. Verify touch interactions and gestures on mobile devices. Check performance aspects like load times and animations. Document any inconsistencies found during manual testing.
