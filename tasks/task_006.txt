# Task ID: 6
# Title: Optimize Battery Usage
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve battery efficiency by optimizing background tasks and location services usage.
# Details:
Use the 'workmanager' package (version 0.5.1) for efficient background task scheduling. Implement geofencing using the 'geofencing' package (version 0.2.0) to reduce continuous GPS usage. Use the 'flutter_local_notifications' package (version 14.1.1) for efficient push notifications. Optimize Bluetooth usage with the 'flutter_blue_plus' package (version 1.5.1).

# Test Strategy:
Use Android's Battery Historian and iOS's Energy Log for detailed battery usage analysis. Implement automated tests simulating long-running background tasks and location updates. Conduct real-world battery drain tests on various devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Background Process Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up isolates for efficient background execution of Dart code
### Details:
Implement isolate-based background processing using Flutter's background execution model. Create a callback dispatcher to handle background tasks without affecting the main UI thread. Ensure proper memory management since isolates don't share memory with the main program.

## 2. Geofencing Service Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Implement geofencing functionality with optimized battery usage
### Details:
Configure geofencing services using the background execution framework. Implement location monitoring with appropriate accuracy levels to balance precision and battery consumption. Set up proper event handling for geofence entry and exit events.

## 3. Notification System Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create an efficient notification system that works with background processes
### Details:
Develop a notification system that integrates with background processes. Implement priority-based notification delivery to minimize battery impact. Configure proper notification channels for Android and notification categories for iOS.

## 4. Bluetooth Communication Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Optimize Bluetooth operations for minimal battery consumption
### Details:
Implement efficient Bluetooth scanning and connection protocols. Use appropriate scan modes based on application requirements. Implement connection pooling and proper disconnection handling to prevent battery drain from lingering connections.

## 5. Battery Usage Profiling [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive battery usage monitoring and optimization
### Details:
Create a battery usage monitoring system to track consumption by different app components. Implement adaptive behavior based on battery levels. Optimize state management with Riverpod to prevent unnecessary rebuilds that consume battery. Configure Firebase and Supabase services for efficient network usage.

## 6. Performance Testing and Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5
### Description: Conduct thorough testing of all background processes and optimizations
### Details:
Perform real-device testing across multiple device types. Use DevTools to identify and eliminate saveLayer() calls that impact performance. Implement lazy loading for UI components to improve startup time. Test background task persistence across app restarts and system reboots using WorkManager plugin.
