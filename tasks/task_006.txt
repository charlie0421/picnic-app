# Task ID: 6
# Title: Optimize Battery Usage
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve battery efficiency by optimizing background tasks and location services usage.
# Details:
Use the 'workmanager' package (version 0.5.1) for efficient background task scheduling. Implement geofencing using the 'geofencing' package (version 0.2.0) to reduce continuous GPS usage. Use the 'flutter_local_notifications' package (version 14.1.1) for efficient push notifications. Optimize Bluetooth usage with the 'flutter_blue_plus' package (version 1.5.1).

# Test Strategy:
Use Android's Battery Historian and iOS's Energy Log for detailed battery usage analysis. Implement automated tests simulating long-running background tasks and location updates. Conduct real-world battery drain tests on various devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Background Task Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement efficient background processing techniques to minimize battery drain
### Details:
Replace traditional background services with JobScheduler or WorkManager. Limit background activities and batch operations when possible. Test with ADB commands to simulate restricted background states.

## 2. Geofencing Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Configure efficient location-based triggers with minimal battery impact
### Details:
Implement low-power location services for geofencing. Configure appropriate geofence sizes and update intervals based on use case requirements. Ensure geofencing only activates when necessary.

## 3. Notification Efficiency [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Optimize notification delivery system to reduce resource consumption
### Details:
Implement a notification batching system. Prioritize notifications based on importance. Use push notification services efficiently and avoid polling for updates.

## 4. Bluetooth Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Enhance Bluetooth connectivity while minimizing power consumption
### Details:
Implement efficient Bluetooth scanning intervals. Use low-energy Bluetooth when possible. Ensure Bluetooth connections are properly closed when not in use.

## 5. Battery Profiling [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4
### Description: Analyze and measure battery consumption across different app components
### Details:
Use battery profiling tools to identify high-consumption components. Analyze CPU and GPU usage patterns. Optimize resource-intensive operations and reduce unnecessary background processes.

## 6. Testing and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.5
### Description: Implement comprehensive testing across various devices and conditions
### Details:
Test on multiple device types and OS versions. Use Android Profiler and Xcode Instruments for performance analysis. Implement crash analytics and performance monitoring tools for real-time issue detection.
