# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Efficient Data Request Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize network efficiency by implementing a robust caching system for data requests.
# Details:
Use the 'dio' package (version 5.1.2) with its built-in caching interceptor. Implement a custom caching strategy using 'shared_preferences' for small data and 'hive' for larger datasets. Use the 'connectivity_plus' package (version 4.0.1) to detect network status and serve cached data when offline. Implement cache invalidation strategies based on data type and update frequency.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for caching logic. Implement integration tests simulating various network conditions. Use mock HTTP clients to test caching behavior without actual network requests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create HTTP Cache Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a service to handle storage and retrieval of cached responses
### Details:
Create a service with methods for get, put, invalidateUrl, and invalidateCache. Implement storage using a key-value pair structure where keys are URLs and values are the corresponding responses. Include proper typing for cached items and consider memory management.

## 2. Implement Cache Interceptor [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create an HTTP interceptor that handles caching logic for API requests
### Details:
Develop an interceptor that checks if a request exists in cache before making network calls. Configure the interceptor in the app module using HTTP_INTERCEPTORS token with multi: true option. Implement request handling logic to determine which requests should be cached.

## 3. Add Time-Based Cache Expiration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement TTL (Time To Live) mechanism for cached items
### Details:
Enhance the cache service to store timestamps with cached responses. Implement logic to check if cached items have expired based on configurable TTL values. Create different TTL strategies for different types of data. Include a mechanism to automatically invalidate expired cache entries.

## 4. Implement Offline Detection and Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Add functionality to detect network status and serve cached content when offline
### Details:
Create a service to monitor network connectivity status. Modify the interceptor to check network status before making requests. Implement fallback logic to serve cached content when offline, with appropriate user notifications. Add queue mechanism for requests made while offline to be processed when connection is restored.

## 5. Create Cache Invalidation Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.3
### Description: Implement mechanisms to invalidate cache based on different triggers
### Details:
Develop methods to invalidate specific URLs, URL patterns, or the entire cache. Implement write-through caching for POST/PUT/DELETE operations to keep cache consistent with server state. Add event-based invalidation triggered by user actions or server notifications. Create a cache header parser to respect server-side cache control directives.

## 6. Write Tests and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Create comprehensive tests and documentation for the caching system
### Details:
Write unit tests for cache service and interceptor. Create integration tests to verify caching behavior with actual HTTP requests. Document cache configuration options, invalidation strategies, and offline behavior. Include performance considerations and memory management best practices in the documentation.
