# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Efficient Data Request Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Optimize network efficiency by implementing a robust caching system for data requests.
# Details:
Use the 'dio' package (version 5.1.2) with its built-in caching interceptor. Implement a custom caching strategy using 'shared_preferences' for small data and 'hive' for larger datasets. Use the 'connectivity_plus' package (version 4.0.1) to detect network status and serve cached data when offline. Implement cache invalidation strategies based on data type and update frequency.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for caching logic. Implement integration tests simulating various network conditions. Use mock HTTP clients to test caching behavior without actual network requests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Caching Interceptor [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a caching interceptor that intercepts network requests and responses to manage cache storage and retrieval for API calls.
### Details:
Integrate the caching interceptor with existing network layers (e.g., Dio or http). Ensure it works seamlessly with Supabase and Firebase APIs. Configure it to check cache before making network requests and to store responses after successful fetches.

## 2. Implement Custom Cache Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Develop custom cache logic to handle different data types, cache expiration, and storage strategies (in-memory, local storage, etc.).
### Details:
Design cache key strategies, set up cache duration policies, and handle serialization/deserialization for complex objects. Use repository pattern for maintainability and testability.

## 3. Integrate Offline Detection and Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Detect offline status and adjust data fetching logic to serve cached data or queue requests for later synchronization.
### Details:
Leverage connectivity packages to monitor network status. Ensure the app gracefully falls back to cached data when offline and syncs pending changes when connectivity is restored.

## 4. Implement Cache Invalidation Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Set up mechanisms to invalidate or refresh cached data based on time, user actions, or remote triggers.
### Details:
Implement time-based (TTL), manual, and event-driven invalidation. Ensure cache is cleared or updated when relevant data changes in Supabase or Firebase.

## 5. Write Unit and Integration Tests for Caching System [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests to verify caching logic, interceptor behavior, offline handling, and cache invalidation.
### Details:
Write unit tests for cache logic and interceptor, and integration tests simulating network failures, cache hits/misses, and invalidation scenarios. Use dependency injection for easier testing.

## 6. Document Caching System and Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Create detailed documentation covering caching architecture, usage guidelines, and extension points for future development.
### Details:
Document setup steps, configuration options, cache invalidation policies, offline support, and testing instructions. Include code examples and troubleshooting tips.
