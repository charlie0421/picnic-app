# Task ID: 14
# Title: Refactor Code Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Restructure the codebase to improve separation of concerns and modularity.
# Details:
Implement Clean Architecture principles. Use 'get_it' package (version 7.6.0) for dependency injection. Implement the BLoC pattern using 'flutter_bloc' package (version 8.1.3) for state management. Use 'freezed' package (version 2.3.5) for immutable state classes.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each layer of the Clean Architecture. Implement integration tests for full feature flows. Use static analysis tools like 'dart analyze' for code quality checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Architecture Planning and Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze current architecture, identify pain points, and design the target architecture with clear goals and principles.
### Details:
Conduct a thorough analysis of the existing codebase structure, identify architectural debt, document current dependencies, and create diagrams of both current and target architectures. Define clear architectural principles and patterns to follow.

## 2. Dependency Injection Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Establish a dependency injection system to decouple components and improve testability.
### Details:
Select appropriate DI framework, create service provider configurations, define injection patterns, and establish container setup. Create interfaces for all major services and implement factory patterns where needed.

## 3. State Management Refactoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Implement a consistent state management approach across the application.
### Details:
Analyze current state management practices, define a unified approach, create state containers/stores, implement unidirectional data flow, and ensure proper separation between UI and business logic.

## 4. Code Modularization Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Restructure codebase into logical, loosely-coupled modules with clear boundaries.
### Details:
Define module boundaries, create folder structure, establish module interfaces, implement internal encapsulation, and ensure modules communicate only through defined APIs.

## 5. Automated Testing Infrastructure [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.2, 14.3, 14.4
### Description: Establish comprehensive testing framework before migrating features.
### Details:
Set up unit testing framework, create integration test suites, implement end-to-end testing capabilities, establish CI pipeline for tests, and define test coverage requirements for all new and refactored code.

## 6. Feature Migration and Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4, 14.5
### Description: Incrementally migrate features to the new architecture while maintaining functionality.
### Details:
Prioritize features for migration, implement feature flags for gradual rollout, refactor one component at a time, ensure backward compatibility, and validate each migration with comprehensive tests.

## 7. Static Analysis and Code Quality Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Implement static analysis tools to enforce architectural patterns and code quality.
### Details:
Select and configure linting tools, set up static code analyzers, implement architectural validation tools, establish code style guides, and integrate all tools into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 8. Documentation and Knowledge Transfer [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.6
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation of the new architecture and conduct knowledge sharing sessions.
### Details:
Document architectural decisions and rationale, create developer guides, update API documentation, diagram the new system architecture, and conduct training sessions for the development team.
