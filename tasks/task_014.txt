# Task ID: 14
# Title: Refactor Code Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Restructure the codebase to improve separation of concerns and modularity.
# Details:
Implement Clean Architecture principles. Use 'get_it' package (version 7.6.0) for dependency injection. Implement the BLoC pattern using 'flutter_bloc' package (version 8.1.3) for state management. Use 'freezed' package (version 2.3.5) for immutable state classes.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each layer of the Clean Architecture. Implement integration tests for full feature flows. Use static analysis tools like 'dart analyze' for code quality checks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define and Document Target Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze current app structure and define the target architecture (e.g., MVVM, Clean Architecture) suitable for Flutter, considering separation of concerns and scalability.
### Details:
Review existing codebase, document current architecture, and create diagrams and documentation for the new architecture, including layers (UI, ViewModel, Repository, Service) and their responsibilities.

## 2. Set Up Dependency Injection Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1
### Description: Integrate and configure a dependency injection solution (e.g., get_it, riverpod DI) to manage object creation and dependencies across the app.
### Details:
Choose a DI framework, refactor existing service and repository instantiations, and ensure all dependencies are injected according to the new architecture.

## 3. Refactor State Management with Riverpod [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2
### Description: Update and refactor state management logic to align with the new architecture, leveraging Riverpod for state and provider management.
### Details:
Identify all stateful components, migrate legacy state management to Riverpod where needed, and ensure state flows are consistent with MVVM or chosen pattern.

## 4. Modularize Codebase [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.1, 14.2, 14.3
### Description: Restructure the codebase into feature-based or layer-based modules to improve maintainability and scalability.
### Details:
Split code into modules/packages (e.g., features, core, shared, data), update imports, and enforce clear boundaries between modules.

## 5. Migrate Existing Features to New Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.4
### Description: Incrementally migrate existing features (UI, logic, data access) to the new modular architecture, ensuring compatibility with Supabase, Firebase, and lazy loading.
### Details:
For each feature, refactor views, view models, repositories, and services; update integrations with Supabase and Firebase; and ensure lazy loading is preserved.

## 6. Implement and Update Automated Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 14.5
### Description: Write and update unit, widget, and integration tests to cover refactored modules and features, ensuring correctness and preventing regressions.
### Details:
Create test cases for each module and feature, mock dependencies as needed, and ensure CI/CD pipelines run all tests successfully.

## 7. Integrate Static Analysis and Code Quality Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and enforce static analysis tools (e.g., Dart analyzer, lint rules, code formatters) to maintain code quality and consistency.
### Details:
Configure analysis_options.yaml, add recommended lints, and integrate tools into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous code quality checks.

## 8. Update and Expand Project Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the new architecture, module structure, dependency injection setup, state management patterns, and migration steps for future contributors.
### Details:
Update README, add architecture diagrams, write guides for adding new features, and document testing and CI/CD processes.
