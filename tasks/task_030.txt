# Task ID: 30
# Title: Document WeChat Login Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create comprehensive documentation for all WeChat login configuration parameters including App ID, App Secret, Universal Link, and platform-specific settings to enable developers to easily implement WeChat login.
# Details:
1. Gather all required WeChat login configuration parameters:
   - App ID and App Secret acquisition process
   - Universal Link setup for iOS
   - URL Scheme configuration
   - Android package name and signature requirements
   - Required permissions for both platforms
   - WeChat developer console settings

2. Create a step-by-step configuration guide:
   - WeChat Developer Account registration process
   - App creation in WeChat developer console
   - Obtaining necessary credentials (App ID, App Secret)
   - Setting up redirect URLs and callback endpoints
   - Configuring Universal Links for iOS
   - Setting up Android package signatures
   - Adding required permissions to manifests
   - Configuring platform-specific settings in Xcode and Android Studio

3. Document integration with the 'fluwx' package:
   - Required package version (3.13.1 or latest stable)
   - Initialization code examples
   - Configuration parameters in Flutter
   - Platform-specific setup for the package
   - Common error codes and troubleshooting

4. Create visual aids:
   - Screenshots of WeChat developer console
   - Annotated configuration screens
   - Diagrams of authentication flow
   - Code snippets with highlighted configuration parameters

5. Include security best practices:
   - Secure storage of App Secret
   - Token handling recommendations
   - Compliance with Chinese regulations for user data

6. Provide a configuration checklist:
   - Pre-implementation requirements
   - During-implementation verification steps
   - Post-implementation validation tests

# Test Strategy:
1. Documentation review:
   - Have at least two developers review the documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Verify all required parameters are documented with clear explanations
   - Ensure platform-specific instructions are accurate and up-to-date
   - Check that all screenshots and visual aids are clear and properly annotated

2. Implementation validation:
   - Have a developer who wasn't involved in the WeChat login implementation follow the documentation to configure a test project
   - Time how long it takes to complete the configuration using only the documentation
   - Document any points of confusion or missing information
   - Verify successful WeChat login using the configuration

3. Documentation testing:
   - Test each configuration step in isolation to verify accuracy
   - Verify all links to external resources are working
   - Ensure code examples are syntactically correct and functional
   - Test the troubleshooting section against common error scenarios

4. Accessibility and format check:
   - Ensure documentation is available in appropriate formats (PDF, Markdown, internal wiki)
   - Check that all images have proper alt text
   - Verify documentation follows company style guidelines
   - Ensure documentation is properly versioned and dated
