# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Performance Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an automated performance testing system to detect regressions.
# Details:
Use 'integration_test' package for performance benchmarking. Implement custom performance metrics using Flutter's 'dart:developer' TimelineTask API. Use 'flutter_driver' for frame timing tests. Integrate performance tests in the CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Create benchmark tests for key performance metrics (startup time, frame rate, memory usage). Implement automated performance regression detection. Conduct regular manual performance audits using Flutter DevTools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up performance testing environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure hardware and software environment that closely matches production for reliable performance testing
### Details:
Provision test cluster with minimum hardware requirements (8+ cores CPU, 32+ GB RAM, SSD/NVMe storage, 10 Gbps network). Ensure the environment is isolated from development libraries that might conflict with workload libraries. Configure settings to reflect production deployment.

## 2. Define performance metrics and objectives [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Establish clear performance objectives and identify key metrics to measure
### Details:
Define specific metrics for load testing, stress testing, endurance testing, availability testing, configuration testing, and isolation testing. Set acceptable thresholds and measurements for each metric. Document performance goals that align with business requirements.

## 3. Implement benchmark tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Create automated performance tests that simulate realistic user scenarios
### Details:
Develop benchmark tests that cover different types of performance testing (load, stress, endurance, etc.). Ensure tests simulate real-world user behavior rather than just server performance. Implement proper logging and segregation of test results for analysis.

## 4. Establish regression detection mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3
### Description: Create a system to identify performance degradation between test runs
### Details:
Implement comparison logic to detect performance regressions between test runs. Set up alerting for when metrics exceed defined thresholds. Create visualization dashboards to track performance trends over time. Ensure the ability to triage performance issues in the testing environment.

## 5. Integrate performance testing into CI pipeline [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Automate performance testing as part of the continuous integration process
### Details:
Configure CI pipeline to run performance tests automatically on code changes. Set up gates that prevent merging code that causes performance regressions. Implement scheduling for more intensive performance tests that may not run on every commit.

## 6. Establish manual performance audit process [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.5
### Description: Create procedures for periodic in-depth performance reviews
### Details:
Define schedule for manual performance audits. Create templates for performance review reports. Establish process for deeper analysis using APM tools to examine application functionality under load. Document procedures for addressing identified performance issues.
