# Task ID: 22
# Title: Implement Performance Testing Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 20
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop an automated performance testing system to detect regressions.
# Details:
Use 'integration_test' package for performance benchmarking. Implement custom performance metrics using Flutter's 'dart:developer' TimelineTask API. Use 'flutter_driver' for frame timing tests. Integrate performance tests in the CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Create benchmark tests for key performance metrics (startup time, frame rate, memory usage). Implement automated performance regression detection. Conduct regular manual performance audits using Flutter DevTools.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Performance Test Environment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the development environment for performance testing with necessary tools and dependencies
### Details:
Install required packages (firebase_performance, integration_test), configure Flutter driver, set up profile mode compilation flags, and prepare the test directory structure for performance testing

## 2. Define Performance Metrics and Thresholds [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1
### Description: Identify key performance indicators and establish baseline thresholds for the Flutter app
### Details:
Define metrics for frame rendering times, startup duration, memory usage with Riverpod state management, network request latency with Supabase/Firebase, and establish acceptable thresholds for each metric based on initial benchmarks

## 3. Implement Benchmark Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.1, 22.2
### Description: Create automated performance tests for critical user flows and components
### Details:
Develop integration tests that measure performance of lazy loading system, Riverpod state updates, Firebase/Supabase data fetching operations, and UI rendering performance using traceAction() for timeline recording

## 4. Set Up Regression Detection System [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.3
### Description: Implement a system to detect performance regressions between app versions
### Details:
Create scripts to compare performance metrics across builds, implement alerting when metrics exceed thresholds, and develop visualization tools for performance trends over time

## 5. CI/CD Integration for Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.3, 22.4
### Description: Integrate performance tests into the continuous integration pipeline
### Details:
Configure CI workflow to run performance tests in profile mode, store test results as artifacts, block merges when performance degrades significantly, and generate performance reports for each build

## 6. Manual Performance Audit Process [pending]
### Dependencies: 22.2, 22.5
### Description: Establish a process for regular manual performance reviews and optimizations
### Details:
Create checklist for manual performance reviews, schedule periodic deep-dive sessions using DevTools Timeline view, document optimization techniques for Riverpod state management and Firebase/Supabase interactions, and maintain performance optimization documentation
