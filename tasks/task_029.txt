# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Region-Based Login Options Control
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 28
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a system that displays different login options based on user region, showing only Apple and WeChat login for Chinese users while displaying all login options for users in other regions.
# Details:
This task involves implementing region-based login option control with the following steps:

1. Create a region detection service:
   - Implement IP-based geolocation using a reliable third-party service (e.g., ipinfo.io, MaxMind GeoIP)
   - Add fallback mechanisms such as browser locale or device settings when IP detection fails
   - Create a caching mechanism to avoid repeated API calls for the same user
   - Implement proper error handling for network failures or ambiguous results

2. Define region-specific login configurations:
   - Create a configuration map that defines available login options by region
   - For China: limit to Apple and WeChat login options only
   - For other regions: show all available login options (Google, Apple, Kakao, WeChat)
   - Make the configuration easily updatable for future region-specific requirements

3. Modify the login screen logic:
   - Integrate the region detection service into the login screen initialization
   - Filter the displayed login buttons based on the detected region
   - Ensure the UI adapts gracefully to different numbers of login options
   - Maintain the last login method preference within the constraints of available options

4. Implement proper loading states:
   - Show a loading indicator while region detection is in progress
   - Have a reasonable timeout for region detection to prevent blocking the UI
   - Provide a fallback to show all login options if region detection fails

5. Privacy considerations:
   - Add appropriate privacy notices regarding geolocation
   - Ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations
   - Only store the minimum necessary information about user location

6. Performance optimization:
   - Minimize the impact on login screen load time
   - Consider pre-fetching region information during app initialization
   - Implement background refresh of region data for returning users

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Test the region detection service with mock IP addresses from different countries
   - Verify correct mapping of regions to login options
   - Test fallback mechanisms when primary detection fails
   - Validate caching behavior and expiration

2. Integration testing:
   - Verify the login screen correctly displays region-appropriate login options
   - Test the integration between region detection and login UI components
   - Ensure proper handling of edge cases (timeout, network failure, etc.)

3. Manual testing with VPN:
   - Use VPN connections to simulate access from different countries
   - Verify that Chinese IP addresses only show Apple and WeChat login options
   - Confirm other regions display all login options
   - Test transitions between regions (e.g., when a user changes location)

4. Performance testing:
   - Measure the impact on login screen load time
   - Verify that region detection doesn't significantly delay the user experience
   - Test on various network conditions (fast, slow, intermittent)

5. Compliance verification:
   - Review implementation against privacy regulations
   - Ensure appropriate user notifications about location detection
   - Verify data minimization principles are followed

6. Regression testing:
   - Verify that the last login method preference still works correctly
   - Ensure all login methods function properly in their respective regions
