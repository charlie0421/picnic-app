# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Supabase Row Level Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance data security by implementing Row Level Security in Supabase.
# Details:
Implement RLS policies for each table in Supabase. Use Supabase's policy functions for complex access rules. Implement proper role-based access control. Ensure all client-side queries respect RLS policies.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each RLS policy. Implement integration tests simulating various user roles and access scenarios. Conduct security audits to verify proper implementation of access controls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define RLS Policy Requirements [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze data access patterns and define row-level security policy requirements
### Details:
Identify sensitive data that requires row-level protection, determine which user roles should have access to which data rows, and document the business rules that will govern access control. Create a mapping between user attributes (roles, departments, etc.) and the corresponding data access permissions.

## 2. Implement Database RLS Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Configure row-level security at the database level
### Details:
Enable row-level security on target tables, create security predicates as inline table-valued functions, and implement both filter predicates (for read operations) and block predicates (for write operations) as needed. Set up the necessary database objects to support the security policies defined in the requirements.

## 3. Set Up Role-Based Access Control [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Configure user roles and permissions that integrate with RLS policies
### Details:
Create role definitions that align with the RLS policies, establish user-to-role mappings, configure authentication mechanisms to pass user context to the database, and implement session context management to maintain the current user's security context during database operations.

## 4. Update Client Application Queries [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Modify application code to work with RLS-protected data
### Details:
Update data access layer to properly set execution context before queries, modify existing queries to work with the new security model, implement error handling for block predicate violations, and ensure the application correctly handles filtered result sets that may be empty due to RLS restrictions.

## 5. Conduct Security Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Test RLS implementation to verify proper access control
### Details:
Create test cases for different user roles and access scenarios, verify that users can only access authorized rows, test that write operations are properly blocked when they violate security policies, and perform penetration testing to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the RLS implementation.

## 6. Implement Auditing and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Set up logging and monitoring for RLS-related activities
### Details:
Configure audit logging for all access attempts (both successful and failed), implement monitoring for suspicious access patterns, create reports to review access patterns over time, and establish procedures for regular security reviews of the RLS implementation and its effectiveness.
