# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Supabase Row Level Security
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: high
# Description: Enhance data security by implementing Row Level Security in Supabase.
# Details:
Implement RLS policies for each table in Supabase. Use Supabase's policy functions for complex access rules. Implement proper role-based access control. Ensure all client-side queries respect RLS policies.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each RLS policy. Implement integration tests simulating various user roles and access scenarios. Conduct security audits to verify proper implementation of access controls.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define RLS Policies in Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Analyze app data access requirements and write Row Level Security (RLS) policies for each relevant table in Supabase. Ensure policies are tailored to user roles and data sensitivity.
### Details:
Use the Supabase dashboard or SQL editor to enable RLS on necessary tables and create policies that restrict access based on user identity, roles, or other criteria. Document each policy for future reference.

## 2. Implement RLS Policies in Database [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Apply the defined RLS policies to the Supabase database, ensuring correct syntax and logic for each policy.
### Details:
Execute SQL statements to enable RLS and add policies for SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE as needed. Test policies directly in the Supabase dashboard to verify correct enforcement.

## 3. Set Up Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.2
### Description: Configure user roles and permissions in Supabase and Firebase to align with RLS policies and app requirements.
### Details:
Define roles (e.g., admin, user, guest) and assign them to users. Map roles to RLS policies and ensure Firebase authentication integrates with Supabase role checks.

## 4. Update Flutter Client Queries for RLS [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.3
### Description: Modify Flutter app queries to comply with new RLS policies and role-based access. Ensure proper authentication tokens are sent with each request.
### Details:
Update Supabase and Firebase client calls in the Flutter app, using Riverpod for state management. Handle authorization errors gracefully and provide user feedback.

## 5. Conduct Security Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.4
### Description: Test the app for unauthorized data access, policy bypass attempts, and correct enforcement of RLS and RBAC.
### Details:
Perform manual and automated tests, including attempts to access restricted data, privilege escalation, and edge cases. Use Supabase logs and debugging tools to verify policy effectiveness.

## 6. Perform Security Audits and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.5
### Description: Audit the implemented security measures, review logs, and document the RLS and RBAC setup for future maintenance.
### Details:
Conduct a formal review of RLS policies, role assignments, and client-side enforcement. Document findings, update security documentation, and recommend improvements if needed.
