# Task ID: 2
# Title: Optimize Memory Usage for Large Images
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement efficient image loading and caching to reduce memory leaks when handling large images.
# Details:
Use the 'cached_network_image' package (version 3.2.3) for efficient image caching. Implement lazy loading for images in lists using the 'flutter_lazy_loading_list' package. Use the 'image' package (version 4.0.15) for image resizing and compression before display. Implement memory management using the 'flutter_cache_manager' package (version 3.3.0) to clear old cached images.

# Test Strategy:
Use the Flutter DevTools memory profiler to measure memory usage before and after optimization. Create unit tests for image loading functions. Implement integration tests simulating scrolling through large image lists.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Image Caching [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure image caching using browser cache headers, service workers, or a CDN to ensure efficient retrieval and storage of images.
### Details:
Implement HTTP cache headers (e.g., Cache-Control), consider fingerprinting images for cache invalidation, and optionally use a CDN or service worker for advanced caching strategies.
<info added on 2025-05-28T04:46:10.318Z>
Based on the project analysis, enhance the current caching implementation with the following improvements:

1. Refactor the hardcoded cache policies into configurable parameters that can be adjusted based on device capabilities and usage patterns.

2. Implement a memory usage monitoring system to dynamically adjust cache size limits based on available device memory.

3. Replace the fixed cache size limits with adaptive thresholds that consider:
   - Device memory capacity
   - Current memory pressure
   - Image usage frequency
   - Application state (foreground/background)

4. Optimize the GIF handling process to avoid clearing the entire cache, instead implementing selective purging of least recently used items.

5. Add cache analytics to track hit rates, load times, and memory consumption for data-driven optimization.

6. Consider implementing different caching strategies for different image types (thumbnails vs. full-size images).

7. Ensure proper cache invalidation when content changes on the server side, possibly using ETag or Last-Modified headers.

### Description: Optimize images by resizing and compressing them before delivery to minimize memory footprint and bandwidth usage.
### Details:
Use tools like sharp or Cloudinary to automate resizing and compression, and prefer modern formats like WebP or AVIF for better quality at smaller sizes.
<info added on 2025-05-28T04:52:52.641Z>
Implemented automated image optimization with the following key fixes and features:
