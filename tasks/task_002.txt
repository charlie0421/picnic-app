# Task ID: 2
# Title: Optimize Memory Usage for Large Images
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement efficient image loading and caching to reduce memory leaks when handling large images.
# Details:
Use the 'cached_network_image' package (version 3.2.3) for efficient image caching. Implement lazy loading for images in lists using the 'flutter_lazy_loading_list' package. Use the 'image' package (version 4.0.15) for image resizing and compression before display. Implement memory management using the 'flutter_cache_manager' package (version 3.3.0) to clear old cached images.

# Test Strategy:
Use the Flutter DevTools memory profiler to measure memory usage before and after optimization. Create unit tests for image loading functions. Implement integration tests simulating scrolling through large image lists.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up Image Caching [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure image caching using browser cache headers, service workers, or a CDN to ensure efficient retrieval and storage of images.
### Details:
Implement HTTP cache headers (e.g., Cache-Control), consider fingerprinting images for cache invalidation, and optionally use a CDN or service worker for advanced caching strategies.

## 2. Implement Lazy Loading for Images [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Integrate lazy loading to defer image loading until they are in or near the viewport, reducing initial memory usage and improving performance.
### Details:
Use native 'loading="lazy"' attribute or a JavaScript library to load images only when needed, ensuring compatibility and smooth user experience.

## 3. Integrate Image Resizing and Compression [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Optimize images by resizing and compressing them before delivery to minimize memory footprint and bandwidth usage.
### Details:
Use tools like sharp or Cloudinary to automate resizing and compression, and prefer modern formats like WebP or AVIF for better quality at smaller sizes.

## 4. Design and Implement Cache Management Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Establish cache invalidation, eviction, and update mechanisms to ensure cached images remain current and storage is efficiently used.
### Details:
Implement strategies such as LRU eviction, fingerprinting for cache busting, and periodic cache cleanup to handle updates and storage limits.

## 5. Profile and Optimize Memory Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Monitor and analyze memory consumption related to image handling, identifying and resolving leaks or inefficiencies.
### Details:
Use profiling tools to track memory usage during image loading, caching, and rendering, and optimize code to prevent excessive memory retention.

## 6. Conduct Comprehensive Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.5
### Description: Thoroughly test all aspects of image handling, including caching, lazy loading, resizing, cache management, and memory usage under various scenarios.
### Details:
Develop automated and manual tests to verify correctness, performance, and robustness, ensuring no regressions or memory leaks occur.
