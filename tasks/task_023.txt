# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Test Data Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a system for generating and managing mock data for testing.
# Details:
Use 'faker' package (version 2.1.0) for generating realistic test data. Implement a seeding system for consistent test data across runs. Use 'json_serializable' package (version 6.7.0) for easy mock data serialization. Implement data factories for complex object creation.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for data generation logic. Implement integration tests using generated data. Conduct regular audits of test data for realism and edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Test Data Generation Strategy [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define approaches for generating accurate, valid, and exception-based test data using multiple techniques
### Details:
Evaluate and select appropriate test data generation methods including production cloning with masking, synthetic data generation, and manual creation. Document requirements for data accuracy, validity, and exception scenarios. Consider business logic constraints, database schemas, and data relationships to ensure realistic test data.

## 2. Implement Data Factory Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Develop core components for automated test data generation with appropriate tooling
### Details:
Create a modular data factory system with components for generating different data types. Implement API-driven and/or SQL-driven approaches based on system requirements. Build mechanisms for data masking to protect sensitive information. Include randomization libraries and parameterization options for diverse test scenarios.

## 3. Develop Database Seeding System [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2
### Description: Create mechanisms to efficiently populate test databases with generated data
### Details:
Build database seeding scripts that can populate test environments with the generated data. Implement data slicing techniques to use only necessary portions of production data. Create automation for both setup and teardown processes to ensure clean test environments. Include performance optimization for handling large volumes of test data.

## 4. Integrate with Test Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Connect data generation system with existing test automation framework
### Details:
Develop integration points between the data factory and test automation framework. Create APIs or utilities that tests can call to request specific data scenarios. Implement logging and monitoring to track data usage across tests. Add validation mechanisms to verify data integrity before and after test execution.
