# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Test Data Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19, 20
# Priority: low
# Description: Develop a system for generating and managing mock data for testing.
# Details:
Use 'faker' package (version 2.1.0) for generating realistic test data. Implement a seeding system for consistent test data across runs. Use 'json_serializable' package (version 6.7.0) for easy mock data serialization. Implement data factories for complex object creation.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for data generation logic. Implement integration tests using generated data. Conduct regular audits of test data for realism and edge cases.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Test Data Generation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the structure and requirements for test data, create reusable data generation utilities, and ensure compatibility with Supabase and Firebase schemas. Implement logic to generate diverse and realistic test data for all relevant models.
### Details:
Include support for edge cases and invalid data scenarios. Ensure generated data can be used for both unit and integration tests. Leverage Dart packages or custom logic as needed.

## 2. Develop Seeding System for Test Environments [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Create a system to seed Supabase and Firebase with generated test data before test execution. Ensure the seeding process is idempotent and can be reset between test runs.
### Details:
Automate the seeding process as part of test setup. Provide scripts or commands to seed and clear data. Ensure compatibility with local and CI environments.

## 3. Set Up Data Factory Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.1
### Description: Implement data factory classes or functions to streamline the creation of test data objects within tests. Integrate with Riverpod for state overrides and support delayed loading scenarios.
### Details:
Factories should allow customization of fields and support both synchronous and asynchronous data creation. Ensure easy integration with widget and integration tests.

## 4. Integrate Test Data and Seeding into Test Suites [pending]
### Dependencies: 23.2, 23.3
### Description: Update unit, widget, and integration tests to utilize the data factories and seeding system. Ensure tests are isolated, reproducible, and compatible with Riverpod state management and delayed loading logic.
### Details:
Refactor existing tests to use new utilities. Add setup and teardown hooks for data seeding and cleanup. Validate that tests run reliably in local and CI environments.
