# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation support.
# Details:
Use Flutter's built-in 'Semantics' widget to provide additional context for screen readers. Implement custom 'FocusNode' for improved keyboard navigation. Use 'flutter_tts' package (version 3.7.0) for text-to-speech functionality. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate 'Semantics' labels.

# Test Strategy:
Use accessibility scanner tools (Android) and Accessibility Inspector (iOS) for automated checks. Conduct manual testing with screen readers like TalkBack and VoiceOver. Implement unit tests for semantic label generation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Semantics Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement semantic labels and descriptions throughout the Flutter app to improve screen reader compatibility
### Details:
Add semantics widgets to all interactive elements, implement custom semantic descriptions for complex UI components, and ensure proper focus order using Semantics and MergeSemantics widgets with Supabase and Firebase integration points

## 2. Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Enhance the app with comprehensive keyboard navigation support using Flutter's focus system
### Details:
Implement FocusNode management, add keyboard shortcuts using Shortcuts widget, ensure logical tab order across all screens, and integrate with Riverpod state management to maintain focus state across navigation events

## 3. Text-to-Speech Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Integrate text-to-speech functionality to read content aloud for visually impaired users
### Details:
Implement Flutter TTS package, create service layer for TTS that works with the existing state management, add controls for speech rate and pitch, and ensure compatibility with lazy loading system for dynamic content

## 4. Accessibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Conduct comprehensive accessibility testing across different platforms and devices
### Details:
Use Flutter's SemanticsDebugger, test with screen readers (TalkBack for Android, VoiceOver for iOS), verify color contrast ratios, and create automated accessibility tests using integration testing framework

## 5. User Feedback Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Implement a system to collect and analyze user feedback on accessibility features
### Details:
Create in-app feedback forms using Firebase for data collection, implement analytics to track accessibility feature usage, design A/B testing for different accessibility approaches, and establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement
