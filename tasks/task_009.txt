# Task ID: 9
# Title: Enhance Accessibility Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Improve screen reader compatibility and keyboard navigation support.
# Details:
Use Flutter's built-in 'Semantics' widget to provide additional context for screen readers. Implement custom 'FocusNode' for improved keyboard navigation. Use 'flutter_tts' package (version 3.7.0) for text-to-speech functionality. Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate 'Semantics' labels.

# Test Strategy:
Use accessibility scanner tools (Android) and Accessibility Inspector (iOS) for automated checks. Conduct manual testing with screen readers like TalkBack and VoiceOver. Implement unit tests for semantic label generation.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Semantics Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Add meaningful descriptions and labels to UI elements using Flutter's Semantics widget
### Details:
Use the Semantics widget to annotate the widget tree with descriptions of what widgets mean. Focus on providing descriptive labels for all interactive elements and important content. Ensure proper semantic hierarchy for screen readers.

## 2. Set Up Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement focus management and keyboard shortcuts for essential actions
### Details:
Manage the focus order of widgets to ensure logical and intuitive navigation. Add keyboard shortcuts for essential actions. Test navigation flow using keyboard-only input to verify accessibility.

## 3. Configure Text-to-Speech Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Ensure proper screen reader compatibility with TalkBack and VoiceOver
### Details:
Test the application with screen readers like TalkBack (Android) and VoiceOver (iOS). Verify that all content is properly conveyed through speech. Adjust semantics as needed to improve the screen reader experience.

## 4. Implement Accessibility Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create automated tests using Flutter's Accessibility Guideline API
### Details:
Set up automated tests using Flutter's Accessibility Guideline API to verify tap target sizes, text contrast, and proper labeling. Create a dedicated test file (e.g., a11y_test.dart) to organize accessibility tests. Test on real devices rather than simulators.

## 5. Establish User Feedback Collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Create mechanisms to gather accessibility feedback from users
### Details:
Implement in-app feedback forms specifically for accessibility issues. Consider setting up user testing sessions with individuals who use assistive technologies. Create a process for prioritizing and addressing accessibility feedback.
