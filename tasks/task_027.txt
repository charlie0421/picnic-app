# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement WeChat Login UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a WeChat login button to the login screen with a design consistent with existing social login buttons, and implement the UI flow for WeChat login authentication.
# Details:
1. Add a WeChat login button to the existing login screen:
   - Use the WeChat brand color (#07C160) and official logo
   - Match the button style (size, shape, padding) with existing social login buttons
   - Position the button appropriately in the social login section
   - Add proper accessibility labels and hints

2. Implement UI components for the WeChat login flow:
   - Create loading indicators for when authentication is in progress
   - Design error message displays for failed login attempts
   - Implement success animations or transitions for successful logins

3. Connect the UI to the existing WeChat login implementation:
   - Link the button's onPress handler to the WeChat login function from Task 13
   - Handle all possible states (loading, success, error) with appropriate UI feedback
   - Ensure proper state management during the authentication process

4. Localization considerations:
   - Add proper text labels in both Chinese and English
   - Ensure right-to-left language support if applicable

5. Responsive design:
   - Ensure the button and login flow UI works correctly on all supported device sizes
   - Test on both iOS and Android platforms

# Test Strategy:
1. Visual inspection:
   - Verify the WeChat button matches the design of other social login buttons
   - Confirm the WeChat logo and colors are correctly implemented
   - Check button positioning and spacing is consistent with other social buttons

2. Functional testing:
   - Verify tapping the WeChat login button initiates the login flow
   - Test all states of the login process (loading, success, error)
   - Confirm appropriate UI feedback during each state

3. Integration testing:
   - Test the complete login flow from button press to successful authentication
   - Verify error handling displays appropriate messages to users
   - Test cancellation of the login process

4. Cross-device testing:
   - Test on multiple screen sizes (phone, tablet)
   - Verify correct rendering on both iOS and Android
   - Test on different device orientations (portrait, landscape)

5. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify screen readers can properly identify and interact with the WeChat login button
   - Test color contrast meets accessibility standards
   - Confirm focus states are properly implemented
