# Task ID: 10
# Title: Complete Dark Mode Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure dark mode is fully supported across all screens of the app.
# Details:
Use Flutter's built-in 'ThemeData' for consistent theming. Implement a theme switcher using 'provider' package (version 6.0.5). Use 'flutter_displaymode' package (version 0.6.0) for proper dark mode on OLED screens. Ensure all custom widgets support both light and dark themes.

# Test Strategy:
Create widget tests for each screen in both light and dark modes. Implement screenshot tests using 'golden_toolkit' package to compare visual changes. Conduct manual testing on various devices to ensure proper contrast and readability.
