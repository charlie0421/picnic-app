# Task ID: 10
# Title: Complete Dark Mode Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None

# Description: Ensure dark mode is fully supported across all screens of the app.
# Details:
Use Flutter's built-in 'ThemeData' for consistent theming. Implement a theme switcher using 'provider' package (version 6.0.5). Use 'flutter_displaymode' package (version 0.6.0) for proper dark mode on OLED screens. Ensure all custom widgets support both light and dark themes.
