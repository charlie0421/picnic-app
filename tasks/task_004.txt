# Task ID: 4
# Title: Optimize Scroll and Transition Animations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reduce frame drops in scrolling and transition animations to improve overall app smoothness.
# Details:
Use the 'flutter_staggered_animations' package (version 1.1.1) for optimized list animations. Implement the 'keep alive' pattern for list items. Use 'RepaintBoundary' widgets to optimize repainting. Implement custom scroll physics using 'ScrollPhysics' for smoother scrolling. Use 'Hero' animations for smooth transitions between screens.

# Test Strategy:
Use Flutter DevTools' Performance view to measure frame rates during scrolling and transitions. Implement automated UI tests that simulate rapid scrolling and screen transitions. Use the 'flutter_driver' package for performance testing on real devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Animation Package Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate and implement animation packages into the Flutter application
### Details:
Research and select appropriate animation packages (like Lottie). Implement basic animations using AnimationController and Tween. Create reusable animation components that follow Flutter's animation patterns with SingleTickerProviderStateMixin. Ensure proper disposal of animation controllers in the dispose() method to prevent memory leaks.

## 2. List Optimization Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize list rendering and scrolling performance
### Details:
Implement ListView.builder for efficient item rendering. Add pagination or infinite scrolling where needed. Use const constructors for list items to minimize rebuilds. Consider implementing caching mechanisms for list data. Measure and compare performance before and after optimization.

## 3. Repaint Boundary Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add RepaintBoundary widgets to isolate animations and improve rendering performance
### Details:
Identify widgets that animate frequently. Wrap these widgets with RepaintBoundary to prevent unnecessary repainting of parent widgets. Test the impact on frame rates before and after implementation. Be careful not to overuse RepaintBoundary as it comes with memory overhead.

## 4. Custom Scroll Physics Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create and implement custom scroll physics for improved user experience
### Details:
Extend ScrollPhysics class to create custom scrolling behaviors. Implement spring animations for scroll boundaries. Add custom friction and drag coefficients. Test the scroll physics on various screen sizes and devices to ensure consistent behavior.

## 5. Performance Testing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive performance testing and optimize animations
### Details:
Use Flutter DevTools to profile animation performance. Test on lower-end devices to identify bottlenecks. Optimize animations that cause jank or frame drops. Implement staggered animations to distribute processing load. Document performance improvements and create guidelines for future animation implementations.
