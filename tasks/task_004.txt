# Task ID: 4
# Title: Optimize Scroll and Transition Animations
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Reduce frame drops in scrolling and transition animations to improve overall app smoothness.
# Details:
Use the 'flutter_staggered_animations' package (version 1.1.1) for optimized list animations. Implement the 'keep alive' pattern for list items. Use 'RepaintBoundary' widgets to optimize repainting. Implement custom scroll physics using 'ScrollPhysics' for smoother scrolling. Use 'Hero' animations for smooth transitions between screens.

# Test Strategy:
Use Flutter DevTools' Performance view to measure frame rates during scrolling and transitions. Implement automated UI tests that simulate rapid scrolling and screen transitions. Use the 'flutter_driver' package for performance testing on real devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Animation Package Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate and implement animation libraries to enhance UI interactions while maintaining performance
### Details:
Select and integrate appropriate animation packages (Lottie or custom Flutter animations). Configure animation controllers with proper vsync and duration settings. Implement memory management by disposing controllers in the widget lifecycle.

## 2. List Optimization Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Optimize list rendering for improved scrolling performance and reduced memory usage
### Details:
Implement ListView.builder or RecyclerListView for efficient item rendering. Add pagination with Supabase/Firebase integration. Configure proper item caching strategy with the existing delayed loading system.

## 3. Repaint Boundary Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add strategic RepaintBoundary widgets to minimize unnecessary repainting
### Details:
Identify widgets with frequent updates that can be isolated. Wrap complex animated components with RepaintBoundary. Measure and compare rendering performance before and after implementation.

## 4. Custom Scroll Physics Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Create custom scroll physics for improved user experience across different screens
### Details:
Extend ScrollPhysics class to create custom scrolling behavior. Implement platform-specific physics variations. Integrate with existing Riverpod state management for dynamic physics changes based on app state.

## 5. Performance Testing and Optimization [done]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Conduct comprehensive performance testing and implement optimizations
### Details:
Set up Flutter DevTools for performance profiling. Measure frame rates during complex animations and scrolling. Identify and fix jank issues. Optimize asset loading with the existing delayed loading system. Test across multiple device types.
