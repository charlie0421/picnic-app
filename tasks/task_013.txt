## 2. Implement Login Flow and API Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the login button functionality and handle the authentication process
### Details:
Process login button clicks, check if WeChat is installed, implement SendAuth.Req with proper scope, handle redirects, and process authentication responses from WeChat
<info added on 2025-05-27T08:47:28.273Z>
Found solution for fluwx API issues:

1. Missing fluwx dependency in picnic_lib/pubspec.yaml (currently only in picnic_app)
2. Incorrect API usage with current fluwx 3.13.1
3. API changes in latest fluwx 5.5.3

Implementation corrections:
- Add fluwx dependency to picnic_lib/pubspec.yaml
- Update code to use proper API:
  - Initialize with `Fluwx fluwx = Fluwx();`
  - Register with `fluwx.registerApi(appId: ..., universalLink: ...)`
  - Check installation with `fluwx.isWeChatInstalled()`
  - Use `sendWeChatAuth()` method for authentication

✅ **fluwx API 문제 해결 완료!**

**문제 해결 과정:**
1. **의존성 문제 해결**: picnic_lib/pubspec.yaml에 fluwx: ^3.13.1 추가
2. **올바른 API 사용법 적용**: 
   - `registerWxApi()` 함수 직접 사용 (클래스 인스턴스 아님)
   - `isWeChatInstalled` getter 사용
   - `sendWeChatAuth()` 함수는 bool 반환
   - 응답은 `weChatResponseEventHandler` 스트림으로 수신

**수정된 코드 구조:**
```dart
// WeChat SDK 초기화
await registerWxApi(appId: ..., universalLink: ...);

// WeChat 설치 확인  
final isInstalled = await isWeChatInstalled;

// 인증 요청 (비동기 스트림 방식)
final completer = Completer<WeChatAuthResponse>();
subscription = weChatResponseEventHandler.listen((response) {
  if (response is WeChatAuthResponse) {
    completer.complete(response);
  }
});
await sendWeChatAuth(scope: "snsapi_userinfo", state: "...");
final authResult = await completer.future.timeout(...);
```

**현재 상태**: 
- ✅ 컴파일 성공 (warning만 존재, 오류 없음)
- ✅ fluwx 3.13.1 API 정확히 사용
- ✅ 스트림 기반 응답 처리 구현
- ✅ 타임아웃 및 에러 핸들링 포함

**다음 단계**: 실제 서버 연동 (token exchange) 및 테스트

## 3. Secure Token Storage Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 13.2
### Description: Develop secure storage mechanisms for authentication tokens and user credentials
### Details:
Implement encryption for stored tokens, create secure token refresh mechanisms, establish token expiration handling, and ensure compliance with security best practices

<info added on 2025-05-28T03:25:15.975Z>
## Regulatory Compliance Review Completed

### Completed Review Items:

1. **Data Protection & Privacy Processing**:
   - WeChat tokens encrypted and stored using FlutterSecureStorage
   - Only essential user information stored (openId, unionId, nickname)
   - Automatic token deletion upon expiration to maintain data minimization
   - Automatic token cleanup on errors for security maintenance

2. **WeChat Platform Policy Compliance**:
   - Official fluwx SDK implementation (WeChat-approved SDK)
   - Proper WeChat API call patterns implemented
   - WeChat app installation verification before login
   - Appropriate handling of user cancellations

3. **Security Best Practices**:
   - Prevention of app_secret exposure on client-side (server-side token exchange structure)
   - Token refresh mechanism implementation
   - Proper error handling and logging
   - Timeout settings to prevent infinite waiting

4. **App Store Policy Considerations**:
   - iOS: WeChat URL scheme registration in Info.plist
   - Android: WeChat app query permissions added to AndroidManifest.xml
   - Prevention of automatic login without user consent
   - Login processes triggered only by explicit user actions

5. **Chinese Regulatory Considerations**:
   - WeChat is a legally compliant social platform in China
   - User data processed according to WeChat policies
   - Additional compliance implementation possible on server-side if needed

### Recommendations:
1. **For Server-Side Implementation**: 
   - Maintain WeChat API call logs
   - Store user consent records
   - Implement data deletion request mechanisms

2. **Before Production Deployment**:
   - Register and approve app in WeChat developer account
   - Test with actual WeChat API keys
   - Explicitly mention WeChat login in privacy policy

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Track WeChat login success/failure rates
   - Monitor token renewal failures
   - Collect user feedback

### Current Status: 
- Basic compliance requirements met
- Security best practices applied
- Platform policies adhered to
- Additional review needed for server-side implementation
