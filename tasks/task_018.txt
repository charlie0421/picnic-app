# Task ID: 18
# Title: Optimize Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor data access layer to directly utilize Supabase SDK and remove unnecessary wrappers.
# Details:
Use 'supabase_flutter' package (version 1.10.3) for direct Supabase integration. Implement repository pattern for data access. Use Supabase's built-in offline support for improved performance. Implement proper error handling for Supabase operations.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each Supabase operation. Implement integration tests simulating various network conditions. Use mock Supabase client for testing offline scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Direct SDK Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor data access layers to use Supabase and Firebase SDKs directly, replacing any existing abstraction or indirect access patterns.
### Details:
Update repository and service classes to interact with Supabase and Firebase SDKs directly. Ensure all CRUD operations and authentication flows are migrated. Remove deprecated or redundant code.

## 2. Repository Pattern Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Implement the repository pattern to abstract data sources and provide a unified interface for data access throughout the app.
### Details:
Design repository interfaces and concrete implementations for Supabase and Firebase. Integrate with Riverpod for dependency injection and state management. Ensure repositories handle both online and offline data sources.

## 3. Offline Support Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Enable offline data access and synchronization, ensuring the app functions smoothly without network connectivity.
### Details:
Integrate local storage solutions (e.g., Hive, SQLite) for caching. Implement data synchronization logic to reconcile local and remote changes. Handle conflict resolution and background sync.

## 4. Error Handling Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Establish robust error handling mechanisms across all data access and state management layers.
### Details:
Define custom error classes and error boundaries. Implement error reporting, user-friendly error messages, and retry logic for failed operations. Integrate with Riverpod to propagate errors to the UI.

## 5. Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive unit, integration, and widget tests for all new and refactored components.
### Details:
Write tests for repository logic, offline sync, error handling, and UI flows. Use mocking for SDKs and local storage. Ensure high code coverage and reliability.

## 6. Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Document the architecture, repository interfaces, offline support, error handling strategies, and testing approach.
### Details:
Update README, add code comments, and provide usage examples. Create diagrams for data flow and architecture. Ensure onboarding guides are clear for future developers.
