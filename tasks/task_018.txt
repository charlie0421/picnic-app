# Task ID: 18
# Title: Optimize Supabase Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Refactor data access layer to directly utilize Supabase SDK and remove unnecessary wrappers.
# Details:
Use 'supabase_flutter' package (version 1.10.3) for direct Supabase integration. Implement repository pattern for data access. Use Supabase's built-in offline support for improved performance. Implement proper error handling for Supabase operations.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each Supabase operation. Implement integration tests simulating various network conditions. Use mock Supabase client for testing offline scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Direct SDK Integration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the Supabase SDK directly into the application, replacing any existing indirect or intermediary data access layers.
### Details:
Set up the Supabase client, configure authentication, and ensure connectivity to the Supabase backend using the official SDK.

## 2. Repository Pattern Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Refactor data access logic to use the repository pattern, abstracting Supabase operations behind repository interfaces.
### Details:
Create repository classes or modules that encapsulate all Supabase CRUD operations, promoting separation of concerns and easier testing.

## 3. Offline Support Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Implement offline support to allow the application to function when the network is unavailable, syncing data with Supabase when connectivity is restored.
### Details:
Integrate local storage or caching mechanisms, queue offline operations, and handle synchronization with Supabase upon reconnection.

## 4. Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2
### Description: Establish robust error handling strategies for all Supabase interactions, including network failures, authentication issues, and data validation errors.
### Details:
Implement global and local error handlers, provide user feedback, and log errors for monitoring and debugging.

## 5. Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.2, 18.3, 18.4
### Description: Develop comprehensive tests for the new data access layer, including unit, integration, and offline scenario tests.
### Details:
Write tests to verify repository logic, offline support, and error handling, ensuring reliability and correctness after refactoring.

## 6. Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3, 18.4, 18.5
### Description: Document the new architecture, repository interfaces, offline support mechanisms, error handling strategies, and testing procedures.
### Details:
Update or create developer documentation to facilitate onboarding and maintenance, including code examples and usage guidelines.
