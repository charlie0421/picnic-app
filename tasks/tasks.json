Identify the current implementation issue:\n   - Review the login flow to understand why Google login is always displayed as the default\n   - Examine how login method information is currently stored (or not stored)\n\n2. Implement last login method storage:\n   - After successful authentication with any method (Google, Apple, Kakao, WeChat), store the login method identifier in secure local storage\n   - Use `flutter_secure_storage` to save the login method with a key like \"last_login_method\"\n   - Store a simple string identifier (e.g., \"google\", \"apple\", \"kakao\", \"wechat\")\n   - Include timestamp information for potential future features\n\n3. Modify the login screen to prioritize the last used method:\n   - On login screen initialization, retrieve the last login method from secure storage\n   - If a last method exists, visually prioritize that login button:\n     - Option 1: Reorder the buttons to show the last used method first\n     - Option 2: Highlight the last used method button with a subtle visual indicator\n     - Option 3: Show the last used method button slightly larger or more prominent\n   - Ensure all login options remain accessible regardless of which was last used\n\n4.
