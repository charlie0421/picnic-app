# Task ID: 8
# Title: Improve Multilingual Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize translation key management and fix incorrect translations.
# Details:
Use the 'easy_localization' package (version 3.0.2) for efficient localization management. Implement a custom translation key generator to ensure consistency. Use 'intl' package (version 0.18.1) for date and number formatting. Implement a translation review system in the CI/CD pipeline using 'lokalise' API.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each locale to ensure all keys are translated. Implement automated screenshots for each supported language using 'screenshot' package. Conduct manual review of translations with native speakers.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Localization Package Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate and configure localization packages (flutter_localizations, intl) in the Flutter project. Update pubspec.yaml, enable code generation, and set up l10n.yaml for ARB file management.
### Details:
Add flutter_localizations and intl to dependencies. Configure pubspec.yaml with 'generate: true'. Create l10n.yaml specifying ARB directory and output files. Ensure code generation works without errors.

## 2. Translation Key Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create and organize ARB files for each supported locale. Define and maintain translation keys and their values for all app strings.
### Details:
Create app_en.arb as the template. Add additional ARB files for other locales (e.g., app_ko.arb, app_es.arb). Ensure all keys are consistent across files and cover all UI text.

## 3. Formatting Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Integrate date, time, and number formatting using the intl package. Ensure all locale-specific formats are applied throughout the app.
### Details:
Use intl for formatting dates, times, and numbers in widgets. Update UI components to use localized formats. Test formatting with different locales.

## 4. Translation Review Automation [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Set up automated workflows to validate translation completeness and consistency. Integrate CI checks for missing or unused translation keys.
### Details:
Implement scripts or use tools to check ARB files for missing keys, unused keys, and placeholder mismatches. Integrate these checks into the CI pipeline for automated review.

## 5. Locale Testing and Dynamic Switching [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement and test locale switching in the app using Riverpod state management. Verify UI updates instantly on language change and all translations/formatting are correct.
### Details:
Use Riverpod to manage current locale state. Add UI controls for language switching. Test all supported locales for correct translations and formatting. Ensure no untranslated strings remain.
