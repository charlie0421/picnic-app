# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Customizable Push Notifications
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a user-customizable push notification system with personalized settings.
# Details:
Use 'firebase_messaging' package (version 14.6.2) for push notifications. Implement a notification preferences screen using 'settings_ui' package (version 2.0.2). Use 'flutter_local_notifications' for handling notification display. Implement server-side logic for personalized notification content generation.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for notification preference logic. Implement integration tests for notification delivery and display. Conduct user acceptance testing for the notification customization UI.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for Push Notifications [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging in the Flutter app for both Android and iOS platforms. This includes adding necessary dependencies, configuring platform-specific files, and initializing Firebase in the app.
### Details:
Add firebase_core and firebase_messaging packages to pubspec.yaml. Place google-services.json in android/app/ and GoogleService-Info.plist in ios/Runner/. Update Gradle and Podfile as needed. Initialize Firebase in main.dart and set up background message handlers.

## 2. Implement Push Notification Preference UI [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Design and build a user interface in Flutter that allows users to customize their push notification preferences (e.g., enable/disable notifications, select notification types).
### Details:
Create a settings page using Flutter widgets. Use Riverpod for state management to reflect user choices in real time. Ensure the UI is responsive and accessible.

## 3. Develop Server-Side Logic for Notification Delivery [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Implement backend logic to send push notifications based on user preferences and triggers. Integrate with Firebase Cloud Messaging APIs and ensure secure, targeted delivery.
### Details:
Set up server endpoints (using Supabase or Firebase Functions) to trigger notifications. Handle scheduling, batching, and targeting specific users or groups. Store and respect user preferences when sending notifications.

## 4. Implement Notification Display and Handling in App [done]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2
### Description: Handle incoming push notifications in the Flutter app, including foreground, background, and terminated states. Display notifications using platform-specific UI and handle user interactions.
### Details:
Use firebase_messaging to listen for notification events. Display notifications using local notifications plugin if needed. Handle navigation or actions when a notification is tapped.

## 5. Persist User Notification Settings [done]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Store user notification preferences securely in the backend (Supabase or Firebase) and ensure they are loaded and applied on app startup.
### Details:
Create API endpoints or use existing database tables to save and retrieve user settings. Sync settings between client and server using Riverpod for state management.

## 6. Test Push Notification Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 11.3, 11.4, 11.5
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing of push notification integration, including sending, receiving, displaying, and respecting user preferences across platforms.
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests for notification logic. Manually test on Android and iOS devices. Validate edge cases such as permission denial, app in background, and preference changes.

## 7. Conduct Compliance and Privacy Checks [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Review and ensure compliance with platform policies (Google Play, App Store) and privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) regarding push notifications and user data.
### Details:
Audit notification permission requests, data storage, and user consent flows. Update privacy policy and documentation as needed. Ensure opt-in/opt-out mechanisms are clear and functional.
