# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Automated UI Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop automated UI tests for main user flows.
# Details:
Use 'integration_test' package for writing UI tests. Implement page object model for test structure. Use 'flutter_driver' for performance testing. Integrate UI tests in the CI/CD pipeline using Firebase Test Lab.

# Test Strategy:
Create UI tests for all main user flows. Implement visual regression testing using 'golden_toolkit'. Conduct regular manual testing to complement automated tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the necessary test automation framework, including programming language runtimes, browser drivers, and dependencies. Set up the development environment and IDE for writing and executing test scripts.
### Details:
Select the appropriate tools and frameworks based on project requirements. Ensure all team members have access to the configured environment.

## 2. Page Object Model Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Design and implement the Page Object Model (POM) structure to encapsulate UI elements and actions for maintainable and reusable test scripts.
### Details:
Create page classes for each significant UI page or component. Define methods for interacting with UI elements and validating their states.

## 3. Writing Main Flow Automated Tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Develop automated test scripts for the main user flows using the established framework and POM structure.
### Details:
Write scripts that cover critical application workflows, including assertions to validate expected outcomes. Handle test data as needed.

## 4. Visual Regression Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1, 20.2
### Description: Integrate visual regression testing tools to capture and compare UI screenshots, detecting unintended visual changes.
### Details:
Configure baseline image storage and define thresholds for acceptable visual differences. Integrate with the test framework for automated execution.

## 5. Continuous Integration (CI) Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Set up CI pipelines to automatically execute automated tests on code changes and generate test reports.
### Details:
Configure CI tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions) to run tests on pull requests and merges. Ensure test results are reported and accessible.

## 6. Manual Test Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Define manual test cases for scenarios not covered by automation, including exploratory and edge case testing.
### Details:
Document manual test cases in a test management tool. Prioritize tests based on risk and application areas not suited for automation.
