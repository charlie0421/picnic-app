# Task ID: 20
# Title: Implement Automated UI Testing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop automated UI tests for main user flows.
# Details:
Use 'integration_test' package for writing UI tests. Implement page object model for test structure. Use 'flutter_driver' for performance testing. Integrate UI tests in the CI/CD pipeline using Firebase Test Lab.

# Test Strategy:
Create UI tests for all main user flows. Implement visual regression testing using 'golden_toolkit'. Conduct regular manual testing to complement automated tests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Test Framework Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the Flutter testing framework with necessary dependencies and configurations
### Details:
Install and configure integration_test package, flutter_test, and Appium Flutter driver. Create the basic test directory structure and configure test runners for both unit and integration tests. Set up test environment variables for Supabase and Firebase connections.

## 2. Page Object Model Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Create a structured Page Object Model for all main screens in the application
### Details:
Develop page objects for login, home, profile, and feature screens. Implement screen actions, element finders, and validation methods for each page. Create base page class with common methods for navigation and state verification. Ensure compatibility with Riverpod state management system.

## 3. Main Flow Test Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.2
### Description: Develop automated tests for critical user flows and functionality
### Details:
Write tests for authentication flows using Supabase/Firebase. Implement tests for core features with state management verification. Create tests for lazy loading functionality and performance metrics. Add test coverage for error handling and edge cases.

## 4. Visual Regression Testing Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.1
### Description: Implement visual regression testing to detect UI changes
### Details:
Set up golden test infrastructure for UI components. Create baseline screenshots for all critical screens. Implement comparison logic with acceptable thresholds. Configure visual tests to run on different device sizes and orientations.

## 5. CI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3, 20.4
### Description: Integrate automated tests into the CI/CD pipeline
### Details:
Configure GitHub Actions or similar CI tool to run tests on pull requests. Set up test reporting and artifact storage for test results. Implement parallel test execution for faster feedback. Create notification system for test failures.

## 6. Manual Test Planning [pending]
### Dependencies: 20.3
### Description: Create comprehensive manual test plans to complement automated testing
### Details:
Document test scenarios that are difficult to automate. Create exploratory testing guidelines for new features. Develop regression test checklists for critical functionality. Establish user acceptance testing procedures with stakeholders.
