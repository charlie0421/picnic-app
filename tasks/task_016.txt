# Task ID: 16
# Title: Enhance Code Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: low
# Description: Improve code documentation with standard doc comments for key classes and functions.
# Details:
Use Dart's built-in documentation comments (///). Implement consistent documentation style across the project. Use 'dartdoc' tool for generating HTML documentation. Integrate documentation checks in the CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
Use 'dart doc' to generate documentation and check for completeness. Implement a linter rule for enforcing documentation on public APIs. Conduct peer reviews for documentation clarity and completeness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Documentation Style Guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation style guidelines for the Flutter app project using Supabase, Firebase, Riverpod, and lazy loading systems
### Details:
Establish consistent documentation format including header styles, code block formatting, naming conventions, and documentation structure. Define standards for documenting state management with Riverpod, backend interactions with Supabase/Firebase, and lazy loading implementation. Create templates for different documentation types (API, component, architecture).

## 2. Implement Codebase Annotation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Add detailed annotations and comments throughout the codebase following the established style guidelines
### Details:
Annotate all major components including Riverpod providers, state notifiers, and consumer widgets. Document Firebase and Supabase service implementations with usage examples. Add detailed comments for lazy loading system implementation. Create class and method level documentation with parameter descriptions and return value explanations. Include architecture diagrams in markdown format within key files.

## 3. Generate and Validate Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1, 16.2
### Description: Generate comprehensive documentation from annotations and validate against style guidelines
### Details:
Use dartdoc to generate API documentation from code annotations. Create architecture documentation explaining the MVVM pattern implementation. Document state management flows with Riverpod. Create backend integration guides for Supabase and Firebase. Validate all documentation against style guidelines and fix inconsistencies. Create a documentation testing process to ensure continued compliance.
