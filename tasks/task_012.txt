# Task ID: 12
# Title: Integrate Supabase Real-time Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement real-time updates for chat, notifications, and voting/commenting using Supabase.
# Details:
Use 'supabase_flutter' package (version 1.10.3) for Supabase integration. Implement real-time subscriptions using Supabase's 'stream' functionality. Use 'rxdart' package (version 0.27.7) for reactive programming with streams. Implement optimistic UI updates for improved user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for real-time data handling logic. Implement integration tests simulating real-time events. Conduct load testing to ensure real-time performance under high concurrency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Supabase Project Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create and configure a Supabase project for the Flutter application
### Details:
Create a new Supabase project at database.new, set up database tables with appropriate schemas, configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data access control, and generate API keys for application integration

## 2. Flutter Integration with Supabase [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate Supabase client library into the Flutter application
### Details:
Add supabase_flutter dependency to pubspec.yaml, initialize Supabase client with project URL and anonymous key in main.dart, implement authentication flows, and create service classes for database operations

## 3. Real-time Subscription Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Implement real-time data subscriptions using Supabase
### Details:
Set up channel subscriptions to relevant tables, implement listeners for real-time updates, create subscription management system with Riverpod providers, and handle subscription lifecycle (connect, disconnect, reconnect)

## 4. Stream Management and State Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Integrate real-time streams with Riverpod state management
### Details:
Create StreamProviders for real-time data, implement state transformation logic, handle error cases and connection issues, and ensure proper stream disposal to prevent memory leaks

## 5. Optimistic UI Updates [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Implement optimistic UI updates for real-time operations
### Details:
Create state mutation handlers that update UI before server confirmation, implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations, synchronize local and remote state, and handle conflict resolution for concurrent updates

## 6. Testing Real-time Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for real-time functionality
### Details:
Write unit tests for subscription logic, create widget tests for real-time UI updates, implement integration tests for end-to-end real-time flows, and set up mocking for Supabase services to enable isolated testing

## 7. Performance Optimization and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Optimize real-time performance and document implementation
### Details:
Conduct load testing with multiple simultaneous connections, implement connection pooling and throttling mechanisms, optimize subscription payload size, and create comprehensive documentation for the real-time system architecture and usage patterns
