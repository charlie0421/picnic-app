# Task ID: 12
# Title: Integrate Supabase Real-time Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement real-time updates for chat, notifications, and voting/commenting using Supabase.
# Details:
Use 'supabase_flutter' package (version 1.10.3) for Supabase integration. Implement real-time subscriptions using Supabase's 'stream' functionality. Use 'rxdart' package (version 0.27.7) for reactive programming with streams. Implement optimistic UI updates for improved user experience.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for real-time data handling logic. Implement integration tests simulating real-time events. Conduct load testing to ensure real-time performance under high concurrency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Supabase Project Setup and Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize and configure Supabase project with necessary database tables and security policies
### Details:
Create a new Supabase project, set up database schema, configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies to control access to real-time data, and generate API keys for client authentication

## 2. Client-Side Supabase Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Integrate Supabase client library into the application and establish connection
### Details:
Install Supabase client libraries, initialize the client with project URL and API key, implement connection handling including reconnection logic and error handling

## 3. Real-time Channel Subscription Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2
### Description: Implement subscription to Supabase Realtime channels for specific data changes
### Details:
Create channel subscriptions using appropriate topics, implement handlers for broadcast messages, presence updates, and Postgres changes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE events), add filtering logic to process only relevant updates

## 4. Stream Management and Data Synchronization [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Develop system to manage real-time data streams and synchronize with local state
### Details:
Implement data structures to track real-time updates, create mechanisms to merge incoming changes with existing data, handle conflict resolution for concurrent updates, and manage subscription lifecycle

## 5. Optimistic UI Updates Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.4
### Description: Implement optimistic UI updates to provide immediate feedback before server confirmation
### Details:
Create optimistic update patterns for user actions, implement rollback mechanisms for failed operations, ensure consistency between optimistic updates and server-confirmed data, and handle edge cases like network disconnections

## 6. Testing and Load Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5
### Description: Develop comprehensive test suite and perform load testing for real-time functionality
### Details:
Write unit tests for real-time event handling, create integration tests for end-to-end real-time flows, simulate high-load scenarios with multiple concurrent users, and measure performance metrics like latency and throughput

## 7. Documentation and Deployment [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.6
### Description: Create documentation for the real-time implementation and deploy the solution
### Details:
Document the real-time architecture, create usage examples and API references, implement monitoring for real-time connections and events, and deploy with appropriate scaling configurations for production use
