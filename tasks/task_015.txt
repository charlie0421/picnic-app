# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Global Error Handling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a consistent error handling mechanism across the app.
# Details:
Implement a centralized error handling service. Use 'dio_error_interceptor' for network error interception. Implement custom error classes for different error types. Use 'flutter_easyloading' package (version 3.0.5) for consistent error message display.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each error type and handling scenario. Implement integration tests simulating various error conditions. Conduct usability testing for error message clarity and user guidance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Error Service [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a centralized error service to manage and log errors across the application, ensuring consistent error handling and reporting.
### Details:
Create a service class (e.g., GlobalErrorHandlerService) that will be responsible for capturing, logging, and possibly reporting errors. This service should be injectable and accessible throughout the application.

## 2. Intercept Network Errors [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Set up mechanisms to intercept and handle network-related errors globally, such as HTTP request failures.
### Details:
Implement network error interception using middleware, interceptors, or similar constructs depending on the framework (e.g., HTTP interceptors in Angular or middleware in ASP.NET Core). Ensure intercepted errors are routed to the error service.

## 3. Define Custom Error Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Create custom error classes to represent different error types and scenarios for more granular error handling.
### Details:
Design and implement custom error classes (e.g., NetworkError, ValidationError) that extend the base Error class, allowing for more descriptive and actionable error information.

## 4. Integrate Error Handling with UI [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3
### Description: Connect the error service to the user interface to display appropriate error messages and feedback to users.
### Details:
Update UI components to subscribe to error notifications from the error service. Ensure that user-friendly and context-aware error messages are shown, and that critical errors are handled gracefully.

## 5. Test Error Handling Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Develop and execute tests to verify that error handling, interception, and UI integration work as intended.
### Details:
Write unit and integration tests to simulate various error scenarios, including network failures and custom error cases. Validate that errors are correctly intercepted, logged, and displayed in the UI.

## 6. Review and Refine User Feedback [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Evaluate the user experience of error messages and feedback, refining as needed for clarity and usability.
### Details:
Gather feedback from users or stakeholders on the clarity and helpfulness of error messages. Refine UI messaging and error handling flows to improve user experience and ensure consistency.
