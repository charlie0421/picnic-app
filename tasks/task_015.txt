# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Global Error Handling System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a consistent error handling mechanism across the app.
# Details:
Implement a centralized error handling service. Use 'dio_error_interceptor' for network error interception. Implement custom error classes for different error types. Use 'flutter_easyloading' package (version 3.0.5) for consistent error message display.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for each error type and handling scenario. Implement integration tests simulating various error conditions. Conduct usability testing for error message clarity and user guidance.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Error Service Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a centralized error handling service that integrates with Riverpod state management
### Details:
Implement a global error service that captures and processes errors from various sources. Create a custom FlutterError.onError handler and set up PlatformDispatcher error callback in main.dart. Integrate with Riverpod providers to allow state-based error handling across the application.

## 2. Custom Error Classes [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Design and implement standardized error classes for different error types
### Details:
Create a hierarchy of custom error classes including NetworkException, AuthException, DatabaseException, and ValidationException. Implement a RepoException class that can wrap specific exceptions from Supabase and Firebase. Add proper error codes, user-friendly messages, and logging capabilities to each error class.

## 3. Network Error Interception [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Implement middleware to intercept and handle network errors from Supabase and Firebase
### Details:
Create repository wrappers for Supabase and Firebase API calls that catch specific exceptions and convert them to standardized RepoException instances. Implement retry logic for transient network errors and proper authentication error handling. Add timeout handling for slow connections.

## 4. UI Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop UI components for displaying errors to users
### Details:
Create reusable error widgets including error dialogs, snackbars, and inline error displays. Implement error state handling in existing screens that use the lazy loading system. Add appropriate error animations and visual feedback for different error types. Ensure all error messages are user-friendly.

## 5. Testing Error Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4
### Description: Create comprehensive tests for the error handling system
### Details:
Write unit tests for custom error classes and the error service. Create integration tests that simulate various error conditions including network failures, authentication errors, and validation issues. Test error recovery paths and ensure proper state management during error conditions.

## 6. User Feedback Review System [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.4, 15.5
### Description: Implement a system to collect and analyze error-related user feedback
### Details:
Create a feedback collection mechanism that triggers after certain errors occur. Implement analytics to track error frequency and user responses. Design a dashboard for reviewing error patterns and user feedback. Set up automated alerts for critical or frequently occurring errors.
