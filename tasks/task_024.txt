# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Supabase Edge Functions
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop serverless functions using Supabase Edge Functions for complex data processing and API integrations.
# Details:
Use Supabase CLI for Edge Function development and deployment. Implement TypeScript for Edge Functions. Use 'node-fetch' for external API calls in Edge Functions. Implement proper error handling and logging in Edge Functions.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for Edge Function logic. Implement integration tests simulating Edge Function invocations. Conduct load testing to ensure Edge Function performance under high concurrency.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Edge Function Development [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the required Edge Functions using Supabase or Dart Edge, ensuring they meet the backend logic and performance requirements.
### Details:
Write TypeScript or Dart code for Edge Functions, handle input validation, and ensure secure access to environment variables (e.g., API keys). Store code in a version-controlled repository for maintainability.

## 2. Edge Function Deployment Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.1
### Description: Configure deployment pipelines and environment variables for Edge Functions, ensuring secure and automated deployment to the edge environment.
### Details:
Set up deployment via Supabase CLI or dashboard, configure secrets (e.g., API keys), and automate deployments using CI/CD tools. Test deployment process for reliability.

## 3. API Integration in Flutter App [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.2
### Description: Integrate the deployed Edge Functions into the Flutter app, using appropriate HTTP clients and repository patterns for maintainability.
### Details:
Update the Flutter app to call Edge Functions using the http package, encapsulate logic in repositories, and ensure Riverpod state management is used for data flow.

## 4. Error Handling and Resilience [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling for API calls and edge function responses, ensuring graceful degradation and user feedback.
### Details:
Handle network errors, invalid responses, and edge function failures in the Flutter app. Display user-friendly error messages and implement retry or fallback mechanisms as needed.

## 5. Automated Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.4
### Description: Develop and run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests for both Edge Functions and Flutter app API integration.
### Details:
Write tests for Edge Function logic, API integration in Flutter, and UI flows. Use mocking for backend responses and ensure tests cover error scenarios.

## 6. Load and Performance Testing [pending]
### Dependencies: 24.5
### Description: Conduct load and performance testing on Edge Functions and the integrated Flutter app to ensure scalability and responsiveness under high traffic.
### Details:
Simulate concurrent requests to Edge Functions, monitor latency and error rates, and optimize code or infrastructure as needed. Validate that the app remains responsive with delayed loading systems.
